# Dremio MCP Docker

## Vision

Run the Dremio MCP server against your Dremio Community instance,
and have it support application development in my VS Code IDE.

## Backlog

* use supergateway as streamable http proxy in front of the stdio dremio mcp server
* test with the http mcp server in my local vscode
* add the mcp server to serra vine
* add a chatbot to the docs
