# Dremio MCP Docker

## Vision

Run the Dremio MCP server against your Dremio Community instance,
and have it support analysis and application development in your VS Code IDE.

This repository demonstrates how to do this.

## Backlog

* make this a standalone project
  * include the latest dremio edition in the docker compose file (dremio/dremio-oss:latest)
  * enable sample data source
  * write a test script that uses the test data
