# Dremio MCP Docker

## Vision

Run the Dremio MCP server against your Dremio Community instance,
and have it support application development in my VS Code IDE.

## Backlog

* start the dremio mcp server container with the token
* add the mcp server as a service to my local vscode agent
* add workflow to create a container image for the mcp server
