# Doing

## Current Task: Make this a standalone project

**Goal**: Create a complete standalone demo that includes Dremio Community Edition with sample data and a test script that validates the MCP integration.

### Actionable Steps

#### 1. Add Dremio Community Edition to Docker Compose

- [x] Add `dremio-oss:latest` service to `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Configure Dremio with persistent volumes for data
- [x] Set up proper networking between Dremio and MCP services
- [x] Configure initial admin user credentials
- [x] Expose Dremio web UI (port 9047) for management

**Proven working**: Dremio web UI accessible, admin account set up, sample data sources configured.

#### 2. Enable Sample Data Source

- [ ] Research Dremio sample data options (built-in samples or external datasets)
- [ ] Create initialization script to set up sample data source
- [ ] Add sample data configuration to Dremio service startup
- [ ] Document the sample data structure and available tables

#### 3. Write Test Script for MCP Integration

- [ ] Create a test script that validates MCP connection to Dremio
- [ ] Test basic SQL queries against sample data via MCP
- [ ] Verify token refresh functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Add automated tests for common MCP operations
- [ ] Create test documentation with expected outputs

#### 4. Create Complete Environment Setup

- [ ] Create `.env.example` file with all required variables
- [ ] Add setup script (`scripts/setup.sh`) for easy initialization
- [ ] Update README with standalone deployment instructions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

#### 5. Validation and Documentation

- [ ] Test complete setup from scratch on clean environment
- [ ] Update documentation with sample queries and use cases
- [ ] Add performance considerations and resource requirements
- [ ] Create demo video or screenshots of working system

### Acceptance Criteria

- Complete docker-compose setup that starts Dremio + MCP with one command
- Sample data is automatically available and queryable via MCP
- Documentation allows new users to get started quickly
- All components work together without external dependencies

### Current Focus

**Step 1 Complete!** âœ… Dremio Community Edition is working and proven functional.

Next: **Step 2** - Enable Sample Data Source. Since you've already configured sample data sources, let's document them and move to testing the MCP integration.

Working on **Step 1** - Adding Dremio Community Edition to Docker Compose and proving it works.
