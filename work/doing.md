# Doing

## Current Task: Make this a standalone project

**Goal**: 
Create a complete standalone demo that includes Dremio Community Edition
so that user and ai agent can work with the data provided by Dremio.

### Actionable Steps

#### 1. Add Dremio Community Edition to Docker Compose

- [x] Add `dremio-oss:latest` service to `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Configure Dremio with persistent volumes for data
- [x] Set up proper networking between Dremio and MCP services
- [x] Configure initial admin user credentials
- [x] Expose Dremio web UI (port 9047) for management

**Proven working**: Dremio web UI accessible, admin account set up, sample data sources configured.

#### 2. Enable Sample Data Source

- [x] Research Dremio sample data options (built-in samples or external datasets)
- [x] Create initialization script to set up sample data source
- [x] Add sample data configuration to Dremio service startup
- [x] Document the sample data structure and available tables

**Proven working**: Sample data sources configured in Dremio, "Samples" schema available with NYC taxi trips data.

#### 3. Write Test Script for MCP Integration

- [x] Create a test script that validates MCP connection to Dremio
- [x] Test basic SQL queries against sample data via MCP
- [x] Verify token refresh functionality works end-to-end
- [x] Add automated tests for common MCP operations
- [x] Create test documentation with expected outputs

**Proven working**: MCP connection established, sample data queries working (NYC weather data with 3,833 records), token refresh operational.

#### 4. Create AI-Guided Setup Experience

- [x] Create `.env.example` file with all required variables
- [x] Create minimal README pointing to AI-guided setup
- [x] Create bootstrap script for AI agent to guide setup process
- [x] Include validation steps and troubleshooting in bootstrap script
- [x] Move detailed documentation to docs/ directory
- [ ] Do a clean checkout and test the process

**Proven working**: Minimal README created, comprehensive bootstrap script ready, detailed docs moved to docs/ directory.

#### 5. AI-Agent Guided Experience

- [ ] Test complete setup from scratch using AI-guided bootstrap
- [ ] Create sample queries and use cases for AI-human collaboration
- [ ] Add performance considerations and troubleshooting to bootstrap script
- [ ] Validate end-to-end: user + AI agent ready to work together

**Goal**: User clones repo â†’ AI agent reads bootstrap script â†’ Guided setup â†’ Ready to collaborate

### Acceptance Criteria

- Complete docker-compose setup that starts Dremio + MCP with one command
- Sample data is automatically available and queryable via MCP  
- AI agent can guide new users through setup using bootstrap script
- All components work together without external dependencies
- User + AI agent ready to collaborate on data analysis tasks

### Current Focus

**Major Progress!** âœ… Steps 1-3 are largely complete and proven working!

ðŸŽ‰ **Full Stack Demonstrated Working:**

- Dremio Community Edition running and accessible
- Admin account and sample data configured  
- Token refresh working (authenticated successfully)
- MCP server running and responding
- Sample data queries working through MCP (NYC weather: 3,833 records)

**Next**: Create AI-guided bootstrap script for seamless user onboarding.
